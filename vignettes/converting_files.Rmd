Some users may be interested in converting SAS Version 5 Transport files into XPT, or converting from other file types such as SAS7BDAT. There may be some existing processes in place to do this in SAS, such as a post-processing conversion step where files are converted in bulk. This vignette offers some guidance and best practice for doing this process in R. 

## Converting from XPT

Ideally if you're converting from an XPT file or a SAS7BDAT file, the appropriate metadata would be maintained separate from the dataset itself. Inevitably some information will get lost while being exchanged because of differences of what information was applied or how R interprets SAS datasets. This is one reason why **{datasetjson}** improves upon XPTs as an exchange format. In leiu of external metadata, here's an example of how you can make a best effort conversion.

```{r XPT conversion}
adsl <- haven::read_xpt(file.path(system.file(package='datasetjson'), "adsl.xpt"))

#' Gather variable metadata in Dataset JSON compliant format
#'
#' @param n Variable name
#' @param .data Dataset to gather attributes
#'
#' @returns Columns compliant data frame
extract_xpt_meta <- function(n, .data) {
  
  attrs <- attributes(.data[[n]])
  
  out <- list()

  # Identify the variable type
  if (inherits(.data[[n]],"Date")) {
    out$dataType <- "date"
    out$targetDataType <- "integer"
  } else if (inherits(.data[[n]],"POSIXt")) {
    out$dataType <- "datetime"
    out$targetDataType <- "integer"
  } else if (inherits(.data[[n]],"numeric")) {
    if (any(is.double(.data[[n]]))) out$dataType <- "float"
    else out$dataType <- "integer"
  } else {
    out$dataType <- "string"
    out$length <- max(purrr::map_int(.data[[n]], nchar))
  }
  
  out$itemOID <- n
  out$name <- n
  out$label <- attr(.data[[n]], 'label')
  tibble::as_tibble(out)
  
}

# Loop the ADSL columns
adsl_meta <- purrr::map_df(names(adsl), extract_xpt_meta, .data=adsl)

# Create the datasetjson object
ds_json <- dataset_json(
  adsl, 
  item_oid = "ADSL",
  name = "ADSL",
  dataset_label = attr(adsl, 'label'),
  columns = adsl_meta
)

# Write the JSON
json_file_content <- write_dataset_json(ds_json)
read_in <- read_dataset_json(json_file_content)

x <- validate_dataset_json(json_file_content)

```

## Bulk File Conversion

If your intention is to convert files into Dataset JSON format in bulk, there are a couple things you should consider - especially if you're trying to replicate existing procedures done using SAS:

Remember that R by default holds data in memory, whereas work datasets in SAS are still written to disk. This means that if you're doing a bulk conversion of datasets, you'll want to read in and write out one dataset at a time. For example:

- Read in the XPT or SAS7BDAT file
- Write out the Dataset JSON file
- Remove the objects from memory to free up space

It's likely best to wrap the conversion process in a function, because the function namespace will inherently release the temporary objects during garbage collection. Depending on the size of your data, it could be easy to max out memory if you first read in all the datasets.

A second consideration is use of the function `validate_dataset_json()`. Particularly if you have large datasets, we recommend _against_ using this function. The validation it performs is against the Dataset JSON schema - so it's not performing additional CDISC checks on the data. We offer this function primarily due to the fact that
